## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Welcome to the repository for my Aircraft Warehouse website. This was submitted for the jHub Coding Scheme (Exercise 1a).

The jHub Coding Scheme aims to give serving UK military personnel the opportunity to gain valuable coding and AI skills, whilst getting paid to do so, so that they might use these skills to enable an information advantage.

### Built With

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

#### HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure the content of my website. It provides the basic building blocks for all web pages.

#### CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style my HTML content. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual presentation of the website. I chose not to use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap or TailwindCSS as the website is very simple.

The website is responsive and uses media queries to change the size and layout of the elements to suit different screen sizes.

#### JavaScript

JavaScript adds interactivity to my website. It allows me to calculate the total cost of the aircraft in real time as the user changes the quantity and adds optional extras.

#### Deployment

I deployed the website using Firebase hosting as it is simple to deploy using the Firebase CLI and free to use.
